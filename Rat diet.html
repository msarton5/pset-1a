			<h2>Rat Diet</h2>
		<p>Rats have a very loose diet because they are omnivores. Their diet does vary a bit across different subspecies. Brown rats like to eat cheese, large bugs, and leaves, while fancy rats only enjoy the finest of delicacies, such as grass and worms. Black rats and grey rats share a taste for roots such as carrots or beets.</p>
