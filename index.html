		<p>Rats are a species of long-tailed rodent. They are part of the genus rattus. Many people are disgusted when they think of rats because rats are often found in unwanted places, such as the city. Rats also were partially responsible for spreading the Black Plague in the 1300s. But rats are not all that they seem to be; they are actually very interesting animals.
