      <h1>Rats</h1>
      <h2>Habitats and Predators</h2>
   <p>A common misconception is that all rats live in the city! While New York City is infested with rats, rats can be found inother places too. You can find rats anywhere; in the forest, in the marshland, in the countryside, in your basement, and even by the ocean!</p>
   <p>Although they may seem ferocious, rats have many predators. These predators include large birds of prey, like hawks or falcons, and humans.</p>
